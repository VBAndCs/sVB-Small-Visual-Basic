' Welcome to "Sahla" .. the easy educational programming language
' Sahla is written in the educational programming language Small Visual Basic
' You will find the complete Sahla code in the Small Visual Basic samples folder
' It started as an Arabic dialect, then I provided teh English dialect to be easy to use to create
' any other native dialect. I tested that by createing a Frensh Shala dialect in 2 minutes!
' See "Create your native Sahla" in the Help menu.
' Note that Sahla allows you to convert your native dialect to the English one and vice versa
' Just choose the file type from the dialog windows when you ooen or save files.
' This allows kids from diffrent natiossn to program in thier own tongue, while still being able
' to communicate with each other and share codes in the English dialect that can be
' converted to each of their dielects. Eventually this will help kids to het used to prpgram in English.
' Sahla also allows to convert its dialects to Small Visual Basic code, to allow kids to graduate
' to a the next programming level.
' To learn the rules of "Sahla", open the "Help" menu,
' then choose topics from the "Sahal Syntax" submenu.
' Each topic will display an educational program with explanatory comments
' and examples like the one you are reading now.
' There are also some examples bundled with the language, with a shortcut on the desktop.
' You can double-click any of the example files (with the .shlen extension) in the Windows File Explorer,
' to open it directly in "Sahla", hence you can run it by clicking the "Run" command from the "Program" menu,
' or you can simply press the F5 key located on the top row of the keyboard.
' As an example, press F5 to run this program:
Write Line "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
Write Line "Welcome to Sahla"
Write Line "Wishing everyone success:"
Write Line "Eng. Mohammad Hamdy Ganem,"
Write Line "Damietta, Egypt 2025"
' Note: The font size of the output window is the same as that in the code editor here,
' and you can increase it by scrolling the mouse wheel up or down
' while holding the Ctrl key on the keyboard
