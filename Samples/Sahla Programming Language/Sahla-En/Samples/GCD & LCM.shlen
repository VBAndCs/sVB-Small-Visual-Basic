Write Line "Calculating the greatest common divisor and least common multiple for two numbers:"

Write "Enter the first number: "
number1 = Read Number

Write "Enter the second number: "
number2 = Read Number

numerator = number1
divisor = number2

While  divisor > 0
    remainder =  numerator % divisor
    numerator = divisor
    divisor = remainder
Wend

gcd = numerator
Write Line  "Greatest common divisor = " + gcd
Write Line  "Least common multiple = " +   number1 * number2 \ gcd
